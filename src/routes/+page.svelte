  Hi!
</p>
<p>
  I'm Kyle Erhabor, a software developer studying Computer Science at Suffolk University in Boston, MA. I spend my days
  studying and developing software.
</p>
<p>
  My current interests are in application development and systems programming for Apple's Darwin platform. Some notable
  works of mine are the <TextLink href="https://github.com/kyleerhabor/sampled">Sampled</TextLink> music player app and
  <TextLink href="https://github.com/kyleerhabor/advance">Advance</TextLink> image viewer app.
</p>
<p>
  If you'd like to reach me, the best way is to send me an email. I enjoy reading them and will try to respond soon.
