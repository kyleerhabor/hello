Hi!

I'm Kyle Erhabor, a software developer studying Computer Science at Suffolk University in Boston, MA. I spend my days studying and developing software as a passion.

My current interest is in application development for Apple's Darwin platform, its macOS and iOS operating systems, and Swift programming for interfacing with system application programming interfaces (APIs). Some notable works of mine are the [Advance](https://github.com/kyleerhabor/advance) image viewer app and the [Sampled](https://github.com/kyleerhabor/advance) music player app.

If you'd like to reach me, the best way is to send me an email. I enjoy reading them and will try to respond in a timely
manner.
