Hi!

I'm Kyle Erhabor, a software developer studying Computer Science at Suffolk University in Boston, MA. I spend my days studying and developing software as a passion.

My current interests are in application development and systems programming for Apple's Darwin platform, focusing on macOS, Swift, and C interfaces to frameworks. Some notable works of mine are the [Advance](https://github.com/kyleerhabor/advance) image viewer app and the [Sampled](https://github.com/kyleerhabor/sampled) music player app.

If you'd like to reach me, the best way is to send me an email. I enjoy reading them and will try to respond in a timely manner.
